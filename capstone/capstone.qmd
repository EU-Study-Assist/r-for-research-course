You're strongly encouraged to complete all the tasks below on your own.
Since these are foundational skills that should become second nature, please avoid using AI tools at this stage. Instead, rely on general web searches and the official R documentation—both are excellent for building real understanding.

If you get stuck and must use AI, do so carefully. Be sure to read and understand each step of the solution, rather than copying it blindly.

You may complete the tasks using RStudio on your computer or by running the R code blocks provided on this web page -— whichever works best for you.

# Introduction {.smaller}
Zama Fruit Store (ZFS) is located in Qatar 🇶🇦 and is one of the largest fruit retailers in the country. It imports a wide variety of fruits from countries around the world. ZFS has recently restocked its inventory with a new shipment.

You’ve just been hired as a research analyst at ZFS and have been asked to carry out an ad-hoc management based on the latest inventory of the store. 
Below are some of the set tasks.

## Task 1
You've been asked to **Save the fruits available according to their country of origin**.

Origin | Fruit |
:------ | -----:|
Ukraine | grapes, peach, strawberries, apples, banana |
Nigeria | banana, coconut, apples, mango, orange, pineapple, plantain | 
Vietnam | coconut, banana, watermelon, mango, pineapple |
Guatemala | watermelon, mango, avocado, plantain, coconut, banana |
Brazil | kiwi, mango, passion fruit, Pear, coconut, banana |

: Fruits imported to ZFS according to their country of  origin.

```{webr-r}


```


# Task II
Using the newly created vectors, create a matrix. with column name being the individual countries. Determine an appropriate dimension for your matrix. Is it possible to create a correct matrix?

```{webr-r}

```


## Task II

The prices of the variable fruits have been given.

Fruit |  |Cost | 
:--- | -- |---: |
grapes |🍇| 0.6 |
peach |🍑| 0.4 |
strawberries |🍓| 1.3 |
apples |🍏| 2 |
banana |🍌| 1.2 |
coconut |🥥| 2.1 |
mango |🥭| 2.4 |
orange |🍊| 1.8 |
pineapple |🍍| 5 |
plantain |🌙| 1.7 |
pumpkin |🎃| 0.9|
watermelon |🍉| 2.2 |
avocado |🥑| 4.2 |
kiwi |🥝| 3.1 |
Pear |🍐| 4.3 |

: Fruits imported by Zama Fruit Store an their price.

## Task {.smaller}

- Generate a series of vectors, where each vector explicitly combines a country and the fruits it exports. Store these vectors using the naming convention `country_export`. For example, a vector representing Venezuela's export would be named `venezuela_exort`.

- Construct a matrix named `zama_fruit_import` by combining the `country_export` vectors you just created.

- Develop a dataframe that clearly presents the names of the fruits and their associated costs.

- Finally, build a dataframe that includes columns for the `origin country`, the `fruit name`, and their respective `prices`. Ensure that you utilize the individual vectors created in the very first step for this task.
