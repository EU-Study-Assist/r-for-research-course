## Task {.smaller}

- Generate a series of vectors, where each vector explicitly combines a country and the fruits it exports. Store these vectors using the naming convention `country_export`. For example, a vector representing Venezuela's export would be named `venezuela_exort`.

- Construct a matrix named `zama_fruit_import` by combining the `country_export` vectors you just created.

- Develop a dataframe that clearly presents the names of the fruits and their associated costs.

- Finally, build a dataframe that includes columns for the `origin country`, the `fruit name`, and their respective `prices`. Ensure that you utilize the individual vectors created in the very first step for this task.
